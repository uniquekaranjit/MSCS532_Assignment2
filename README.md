# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analyze

This project implements and compares the performance of two popular sorting algorithms, **Merge Sort** and **Quick Sort**. It also generates test data (sorted, random, and reverse sorted) and measures the performance of each sorting algorithm, visualizing the results with graphs.

## File Descriptions

- **`merge_sort.py`**: Contains the implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm.
- **`quick_sort.py`**: Contains the implementation of the **Quick Sort** algorithm.
- **`performance_metrics.py`**: Includes functions to measure and evaluate the performance (execution time and memory usuage) of the sorting algorithms.
- **`generate_data.py`**: Generates test data in three formats: sorted, random, and reverse sorted.
- **`plot_graph.py`**: Creates and displays graphs to visualize the performance results of the sorting algorithms.
- **`main.py`**: The main driver script that orchestrates the entire process, including calling functions from data generation, sorting, and performance measurement.

## Requirements

To run the project, you need to have Python 3.x installed along with the following packages:

- `matplotlib` (for graph plotting)

You can install the required packages using `pip` if needed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
